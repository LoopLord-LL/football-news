      <h1>Christian Eriksen says he "does not overthink"</h1><br>

       <b>  what happened on his last European Championship appearance when he collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in Denmark's defeat by Finland.</b> <br><br>

        Eriksen, 32, is set to face Slovenia in Denmark's opening group game at Euro 2024 in Stuttgart on Sunday (17:00 BST).<br><br>
        
        Now a Manchester United player, the midfielder received CPR on the pitch in June 2021 and was subsequently fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to keep track of his heartbeat.<br><br>
        
        "For me, personally, everything more than one game is an improvement," said Eriksen.<br><br>
        
        "It's been my goal since the beginning to come back to this level. It's been three years; a lot has happened in the meantime.<br><br>
        
        "It's not something I overthink. I just look forward to playing football and look at the positives."<br><br>
        
        His United team-mate Rasmus Hojlund could feature as Denmark, ranked 21st in the world, also face England and Serbia in Group C.<br><br>
        
        "We have to remember to play relaxed but also do our best," said Denmark manager Kasper Hjulmand.<br><br>
        
        "We're a team that wants to dominate. We want to play freely and I think that's the best way. It's always tough in the first game but we just have to do our best.<br><br>
        
        "We're definitely favourites in this game but we have a lot of respect for Slovenia. They have shown some great results. We have to do our very best."<br><br>
    </p>

       <b> 'We have waited a long time for this'</b> <br><br>
        Slovenia are playing in just their second Euro finals, some 24 years after their debut appearance. <br><br>
        
        Manager Matjaz Kek recognised they have "waited a very long time" but hope to show "pride" to represent Slovenia and compete with Europe's best.<br><br>
        
        "The whole atmosphere, the spectacle and the event itself can give us an extra boost. I hope this can happen," Kek said.<br><br>
        
        "We have to be aggressive, we have to run, and if we can do that we will put up a good match against Hojlund, Eriksen and everyone else.<br><br>
        
        "Some see this as a well-paid job but others regard it as a way of life. The floodlights are on the players. This is the stage and the players have to perform."<br><br>
        
        Olimpija Ljubljana midfielder Timi Max Elsnik said Slovenia had "reached our goal" by qualifying, but they still hope to progress from the group stage.<br><br>
        
        "This is not the end. The best teams in Europe play in this competition and we are among them," Elsnik, a 26-year-old former Derby County player, added.<br><br>
        
        "We should not feel the burden. We should enjoy the moments and take them in. Everyone will give everything they have on the pitch."<br><br>
